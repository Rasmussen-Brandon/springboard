### Usage
We recommend forking and then cloning the repo. `cd` into the directory you created with `git clone`. Then run the shell script `deploy.sh`, which defines your workspace and creates a container. As will be evident once you run the script, you simply point your browser to <http://localhost:8081/> and you're off to the races. You'll need to navigate to `datalab/docs-earthengine` to authenticate the container you're running. Your credentials will be stored within the container instance. These authentication credentials will persist until you delete/remove the Docker container.

You can kill the process with `Ctrl + C`.
